# DS-helm-charts

The ds-helm-chart is a repository that contains various configurations of Helm charts for deployment on a Kubernetes cluster. Examples include Segment Anything and Jupyter Notebook. By selecting specific tags within the values file, you can access different GPUs to conduct your machine learning tests.

This project addresses the current challenge of easily accessing GPU instances and setting up a Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to create Helm charts that facilitate the easy configuration of services, allowing access to various GPUs directly from a Jupyter Notebook or for deploying other applications.
